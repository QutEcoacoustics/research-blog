                Paul Roe is a full professor in the Science and Engineering Faculty at QUT, in Brisbane Australia, where
                he leads the Bioacoustic Research Lab. He has published over 80 papers and received over $4 M in
                competitive research funding. His research is focused on smart tools which enable new forms and scales
                of research, particularly in the area of distributed computing.

                Dr Michael Towsey has held research positions at QUT since 1997. He uses machine learning methods to
                solve biological problems. These have ranged from the sublime (analysis of bird song) to the ridiculous
                (analysis of milk yield in cow herds) with some bioinformatics in between! Michael is currently in the
                Bioacoustics Research Group within the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at QUT. He
                works on the ‘big data’ problems associated with long duration recordings of the environment, in
                particular, building recognizers for species of interest, extracting acoustic indices to aid navigation
                and visualisation.

                extending birdwatching to review acoustic recordings</em>. It investigates how to enable bird watchers
                to review audio recordings collected by environmental sensors. Accurate bird call identifications can
                provide reliable information for avian research and conservation efforts. The five studies in this
                thesis yield a nuanced understanding of birders’ activities. Evaluations by birders of two prototype
                websites for analysing audio pinpoint effective design elements. The findings demonstrate that
                audio segments, visualisations, and tailored feedback in a website interface support accurate
                identifications of bird calls that may otherwise remain undetected.
