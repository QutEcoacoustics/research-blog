# Test locally

Local testing needs a working install of `ruby` (version 2.3 or greater).
- For Windows environments the [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) project is a great project; install 
_Ruby 2.3.1 (x64)_ and _DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe_.
- Mac comes with ruby installed, but it might not be a recent version. Test the version with `ruby --version`. If it is too old, 
use rvm to install the new version. This command will install rvm and use it to install the latest ruby `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`.
For details see [How to Install Ruby on Mac OS X with RVM](http://usabilityetc.com/articles/ruby-on-mac-os-x-with-rvm/).
